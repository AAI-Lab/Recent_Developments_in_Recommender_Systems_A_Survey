            <h2>Personalized Recommender Systems</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>
                The emergence of deep learning and the vast availability of online data has made personalized recommender systems more prevalent, significantly enhancing the ease and efficiency with which people discover new experiences. 
                These systems are commonly categorized into three main types: <b>Collaborative Filtering-based</b>, <b>Context-aware-based</b> and <b>Hybrid</b>. 
                Recommender systems have evolved to integrate external knowledge, resulting in <b>knowledge-based</b> recommender systems and the leveraging of <b>LLMs</b> to enhance recommendation efficiency. 
                This paper aims to delve deeper into these advancements, analyzing knowledge-based and LLM-based recommender systems, respectively.

                            <b>Collaborative filtering (CF)</b> leverages the collective knowledge of a large pool of users to  predict an individual user's preferences or opinions, based on the assumption that users who share similar preferences and behaviors will have similar opinions. 
                            This method is driven by user profiles based on <b>historical interactions</b>, such as browsing history, past purchases, or songs played previously. 
                            CF has <b>memory-based and model-based</b> approaches. 
                            The input to the recommendation scoring function is the user interaction data with an item (e.g., user-item ratings or  interactions).

                        Memory-based CF utilizes user or item similarities for recommendations.<br>
                        Recent research on Memory-based CF has focused on refining memory-based CF by exploring new similarity measures, addressing scalability challenges, and considering their integration into hybrid recommendation systems. 
                        Memory-based CF, while not the sole focus of research, still plays a valuable role in providing personalized recommendations, particularly with smaller datasets or when simplicity and interpretability are prioritized.

                            Model-based CF predicts user preferences based on relationships between them and items.
                            With the success of Deep Learning and Graph Neural Network, there is increasing interest in the application of neural networks.

                                    Table 1 evaluates the performance of the RS model, which is based on a GNN, on the <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-eQVwhEAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=sra">MovieLens 1M</a> dataset. 
                                    NDCG@k and Recall@k are selected as the evaluation criteria, where k denotes the system’s TOP-k recommendation.
                                    To standardize the data, model results are rounded to two decimal places. 
                                    The table shows five basic models and two combined models, which belong to the categories of graph collaborative filtering, graph convolutional neural networks, and self-supervised graph learning.
                                    Model-based CF enhances recommendation accuracy by developing various models to extract in-depth insights from user-item interaction data. Despite significant advancements in model-based CFs, there remains a need for new models to augment the interpretability, computational efficiency, and RS accuracy.
                                    It is worth noting that the links of graphs offer a convenient option for mining deep information through multi-hop for the interaction data between users and items. As a result, the GNN will probably become the mainstay of subsequent research.

                            To enhance the decision-making capabilities of an RS, it is important to consider contextual information such as time, location, social status, mood, weather, day type, and language.
                            User activity and contextual information are closely intertwined, with reciprocal effects on each other. 
                            Unlike memory-based  and model-based CF recommendation algorithms, context-aware-based CF requires user and item descriptive information as input.
                            Contextual information can be sourced such as from smart devices providing geolocation data and companion information, or directly from users through their interests.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Recent advancements in contextual information, facilitated by the application of statistical, data mining, and particularly artificial intelligence-based methods, have enabled proactive collection by analyzing user activities within the system, eliminating reliance on self-reported data.
                            Contextual features typically exhibit greater complexity and dynamism than user-item interaction data. For instance, weather conditions, encompassing variables like temperature, humidity, wind, and precipitation, change over time across various scales. 
                            The context derived from smart devices is even more intricate, encompassing sensors such as accelerometers, gyroscopes, magnetometers, GPS, and biometric sensors, potentially amounting to around 600 variables.
                            Incorporating this information into a recommender system poses a significant challenge.

                                    Context-aware-based CF requires datasets to provide context information, including descriptive information of users and items, so that it can be mined to assist recommendations. 
                                    Context information is difficult to combine with deep learning, and will be a focus of future research.

                            Content-based RS treats recommendations as a user-specific classification problem by learning a classifier based on item features, and provides a more personal recommendation. 
                            The RS uses two types of information, the user preference model and user interaction history, to obtain the features of items. 
                            Text data are an important source of feature learning.

                            A notable advantage of Content-based RS is that it allows for item recommendations solely based on their content, without user ratings. 
                            Side information can be metadata or user-generated content, and traditionally consists of descriptions of items or full-text indexing of textual items.
                            Content-based RS has evolved to incorporate a wide range of techniques and data sources, including deep learning, sentiment analysis, and Heterogeneous Information Network. 
                            These advancements have contributed to the development of more accurate and personalized recommendation systems that take into account not only the content but also the context and user preferences, ultimately improving the user experience.

                            Different from CF-based and content-based RS, knowledge-based RS does not rely on user-item interaction history and is commonly used in complex domains where items are not frequently purchased, such as cars, in which users may have constraints such as a budget. 
                            The key factor is domain knowledge, which can include users, items, and their interaction. 
                            Therefore, the input to the recommendation scoring function requires knowledge in addition to the interaction and description information of users and items.

                                Knowledge graph-based RS is a sub-class of knowledge-based RS that leverages the information contained in a knowledge graph to make better recommendations. 
                                The knowledge graph is a collection of entities and their relationships, including objects, relations, and situations. 
                                It provides additional information about the recommender system and enhances the quality of recommendations.

                                        The application of knowledge graphs in RS has gained significant attention in recent years and thus become a popular research topic. 
                                        By integrating the knowledge graph into the recommender system, more evidence can be gathered to improve the quality of recommendations.
                                        Knowledge graphs include YAGO, Freebase, DBpedia, NELL, and Wikidata,  which cover a wide range of domains. 
                                        Specialized knowledge graphs include Bio2RDF in biology, Knowlife for biomedical information, and Satori for production. 
                                        Table 3 provides further details on these knowledge graphs.
                                        A knowledge graph is made up of entity-relation-entity triples (h,r,t), with head h, relation r, and tail t, and can be utilized in three ways in a recommender system: knowledge graph embedding, path pattern learning, and hybrid embedding.
                                        Existing knowledge can be encoded into a higher-level representation, knowledge graph embedding (KGE).

                    Bundle recommendation leverages interaction data encompassing bundles, individual items, and user behavior through deep learning. 
                    While similar, group recommendation systems suggest items to a group of users with shared preferences or interests, aiming to meet their collective needs, while bundle systems recommend predefined packages or sets of items, considering the synergy or co-occurrence within them.

                        Preference aggregation is the predominant method in group recommendation systems. 
                        This approach is typically categorized into result aggregation and profile aggregation methods.
                        Result aggregation is to aggregate all users’ recommendation results to form a comprehensive group recommendation.
                        Profile aggregation generates recommendations for a virtual user, an abstraction derived from the group.

                    Recommender systems face challenges in terms of robustness, data bias, and fairness. 
                    Robustness is the ability to withstand adversarial attacks and eliminate the adverse effects of bias. 
                    Adversarial attacks can take different forms, such as manipulating data, model parameters, or the output of an RS. Data bias results in a skewed snapshot of user preferences, causing suboptimal recommendations. 
                    This can include popularity, selection, exposure, and position bias. 
                    Fairness includes user- and project-based fairness. 
                    In the case of userbased fairness, results are not affected by attributes such as race or gender. 
                    Similar items of the same category should have equal chances of recommendation. 
                    Typical fairness problems include cold-start and long-tail problems.

                        Adversarial attacks have become a popular method for validating the robustness of recommender systems. 
                        Researchers often add perturbations to pixel values or text in image processing or natural language processing systems. 
                        In a recommender system, an item or user can be represented as an embedding, which provides more attack options, including the use of information such as user and item profiles and embeddings, as well as side information.

                        Attacks on recommender systems can be targeted or nontargeted. 
                        Targeted attacks aim to mislead the system from the true class to a specific incorrect one.
                        Non-targeted attacks aim to compromise a model toward any class except the actual one. 
                        While less explored than targeted attacks, they are critical in the assessment of robustness.
                        Targeted attacks are often driven by explicit motives, while non-targeted attacks can undermine the accuracy of recommendations.

                        Defense models, such as adversarial training and model distillation, are often used to improve robustness. 
                        Adversarial training is generally a min-max game between an adversary and a model.

                    There are different kinds of evaluation measurements for recommender systems, depending on the task. 
                    These can be categorized as Rating Based Indicators (RBIs), and Item Based Indicators (IBIs). 
                    An RBI rates the output of a recommender system. 
                    A good recommendation can be inferred from a predicted rating that is close to the truth. 
                    An IBI considers the output of a recommender system as a set or list of items. 
                    A good recommendation is based on the user’s desired match between the predicted item and the target item.

                <hr width="21%" />
                    <P>
                        An RBI evaluates the quality of a prediction rating score. 
                        The direct way is to calculate the gap between implicit and explicit labels.

                    <P>
                        As a recommender system is a set or list of items, if there is no ranking information, the confusion matrix can be adopted for evaluation.

            <p>
                In conclusion, this survey comprehensively reviewed developments in recommender systems, a field that has seen significant recent progress. 
                The diversity of recommender systems and their applications, combined with growing data volume and computing power, has created a rich, dynamic research environment. 
                Recommender systems and Sentiment Analysis are two crucial applications of algorithms, and Malandri et al. have conducted a bibliometric analysis of research articles using structural topic modeling. 
                In the past two decades, research focused on soft computing has shifted from recommender systems to sentiment analysis, and future research in this area is expected to use fuzzy logic for aspect-based sentiment analysis or sentiment knowledge-based reasoning.

            <p>
                This research started with an overview of current trends in personalized and group-based recommender systems. 
                Regarding the former, conventional categorization has been expanded to encompass knowledge-based and LLM-based systems, which have witnessed a significant increase in popularity following recent advancements in deep learning. 
                Personalized recommender system is categorized as collaborative filtering, content-based, knowledge-based, LLM-based, or hybrid.
            </p>
            <p>
                This work considered the concept of group-based recommender systems, distinguishing between memory-based and model-based techniques. 
                Item-oriented group recommendations, notably bundled recommendations, were discussed, and common challenges encountered by recommender systems were addressed, including robustness, data bias, and fairness. 
                The performance metrics were analyzed based on ratings, ranking, and similarity.
            </p>
            <p>
                The rich and dynamic research environment of recommender systems has been created by the diversity of its applications and the growing amount of data and computing resources available. 
                Although the field still faces challenges, such as robustness, data bias, and fairness issues, the future of recommender systems holds great promise and the potential to greatly benefit the human race.
